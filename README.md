This is the code repository for [Hands-On Neural Networks with TensorFlow 2.0](https://www.packtpub.com/in/data/hands-on-neural-networks-with-tensorflow-2-0?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789615555), published by Packt.

**Understand TensorFlow, from static graph to eager execution, and design neural networks**

## What is this book about?
This book is a guide to the TensorFlow (TF) framework, from the static graph architecture of TF 1.x to the eager execution and all the new features introduced in TF 2.0. Neural Networks applications are developed throughout the book with the aim of making the reader capable of developing neural networks-based solutions to real problems using TF 2.0

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Grasp machine learning and neural network techniques to solve challenging tasks
* Apply the new features of TF 2.0 to speed up development
* Use TensorFlow Datasets (tfds) and the tf.data API to build high-efficiency data input pipelines
* Perform transfer learning and fine-tuning with TensorFlow Hub
* Define and train networks to solve object detection and semantic segmentation problems

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example,

The code will look like the following:
```
writer = tf.summary.FileWriter("log/two_graphs/g1", g1)
writer = tf.summary.FileWriter("log/two_graphs/g2", g2)
writer.close()
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you're a developer who wants to get started with machine learning and TensorFlow, or a data scientist interested in developing neural network solutions in TF 2.0, this book is for you. Experienced machine learning engineers who want to master the new features of the TensorFlow framework will also find this book useful.
Basic knowledge of calculus and a strong understanding of Python programming will help you grasp the topics covered in this book.
